This project is a web-based interactive map powered by 11ty and leaflet.js, and
uses vite as the build tool.

- run the full test suite with `npm run test:run`
- always use modern js best practices (don't worry about older browsers or
  backward compatibility)
- prefer a functional approach (map, filter, reduce) and pure functions wherever
  possible
- don't do anything which compromises the accessibility of the finished product
